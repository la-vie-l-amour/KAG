       "     '#甲亢病因#近年来研究发现Graves病的发病主要与自身免疫有关，其他病变引起的甲亢在发病上各有特点或仍有不清之处，现分述如下：\\n免疫因素(30%)：\\n1956年 Adams等发现长效甲状腺刺激素(LATS)作用与TSH作用相近，它是一种由B淋巴细胞产生的免疫球蛋白(IgG)，是一种针对甲状腺的自身抗体，可与甲状腺亚细胞成分结合，兴奋甲状腺滤泡上皮分泌甲状腺激素而引起甲亢。甲亢患者中60%～90%LATS增多，此后又发现LATS-P物质，也是一种IgG，只兴奋人的甲状腺组织，又称为人甲状腺刺激免疫球蛋白(HTSI)，甲亢患者90%以上为阳性。\\n1、甲亢发病免疫机制的直接证据有：\\n(1)在体液免疫方面，已知有多种抗甲状腺细胞成分的抗体，如针对TSH受体的甲状腺刺激性抗体(TISI)，或TSH受体抗体(TRAb)，它能与TSH受体或其相关组织结合，进一步激活cAMP，加强甲状腺功能。这种抗体可通过胎盘组织，引起新生儿甲亢，或甲亢治疗后不彻底，抗体持续阳性，导致甲亢复发。\\n(2)细胞免疫方面，证实这些抗体系由于B淋巴细胞产生。甲亢患者血中有针对甲状腺抗原的致敏T淋巴细胞存在，甲亢时淋巴细胞在植物血凝素(PHA)的激活作用下可产生LATS，PHA兴奋T淋巴细胞后再刺激B淋巴细胞，从而产生能兴奋甲状腺作用的免疫球蛋白，如TSI等，而引发甲亢。器官特异性自身免疫疾病都是由于抑制性T淋巴细胞(Ts)功能缺陷引起免疫调节障碍所致。因此，免疫反应是涉及T与B淋巴细胞及吞噬细胞相互作用的复杂结果。现认为主要与基因缺陷有关的抑制性T淋巴细胞功能降低有关，Ts功能缺陷可导致T细胞致敏，使B细胞产生TRAb而引起甲亢。\\n2、间接证据有：\\n(1)甲状腺及眼球后有大量淋巴细胞及浆细胞浸润。\\n(2)外周血循环中淋巴细胞数增多，可伴发淋巴结，肝与脾的网状内皮组织增生。\\n(3)患者与其亲属同时或先后可发生其他一些自身免疫性疾病。\\n(4)患者及其亲属中的血液抗甲状腺抗体，TRAb及抗胃壁细胞抗体与抗心肌抗体等阳性。\\n(5)甲状腺内与血液中有IgG，IgA及IgM升高。\\nGraves病的诱发始动原因目前认为系由于患者Ts细胞的免疫监护和调节功能有遗传性缺陷，当有外来精神创伤等因素时，或有感染因素时，体内免疫遭破坏，“禁株”细胞失控，产生TSI的B淋巴细胞增生，功能变异，在Ts细胞的作用下分泌大量的TSI自身抗体而致病。有精神创伤与家族史者发病较多，为诱发因素。近年来发现，白种人甲亢HLA-B8比正常人高出2倍，亚洲日本人HLA-BW35增高，国外华人HIA-BW46阳性易感性增高，B13，B40更明显，这些都引起了注意。\\n遗传因素(20%)：\\n临床上发现家族性Graves病不少见，同卵双胎先后患Graves病的可达30%～60%，异卵仅为3%～9%，家族史调查除患甲亢外，还可患其他种甲状腺疾病如甲状腺功能减低等，或家族亲属中TSI阳性。这说明Graves病有家族遗传倾向，这种遗传方式可能为常染色体隐性遗传，或常染色体显性遗传，或为多基因遗传。\\n其他发病原因(10%)：\\n(1)功能亢进性结节性甲状腺肿或腺瘤，过去认为本病多不属于自身免疫性疾病，因血中未检出IgG，TSI，IATS等免疫佐证。1988年国内曾报告单结节检出血清甲状腺球蛋白抗体和微粒体抗体，阳性率为16.9%(62/383)，多结节阳性率为54.7%(104/190)，这些结节中增生的甲状腺组织不受TSI调节，成为自主功能亢进性或功能亢进性甲状腺结节或腺瘤。目前认为甲状腺腺瘤与癌瘤发病还认为系由于肿瘤基因所致。\\n(2)垂体瘤分泌TSH增加，引起垂体性甲亢，如TSH分泌瘤或肢端肥大症所伴发的甲亢。\\n(3)亚急性甲状腺炎，慢性淋巴细胞性甲状腺炎，无痛性甲状腺炎等都可伴发甲亢。\\n(4)外源性碘增多引起甲亢，称为碘甲亢。如甲状腺肿病人服碘过多，服用甲状腺片或左甲状腺素钠(L-T4)过多均可引起甲亢，少数病人服用胺碘酮药物也可致甲亢。\\n(5)异位内分泌肿瘤可致甲亢，如卵巢肿瘤，绒癌，消化系统肿瘤，呼吸系统肿瘤及乳腺癌等分泌类促甲状腺激素可致临床甲亢。\\n(6)Albright综合征在临床上表现为多发性骨纤维结构不良，皮肤色素沉着，血中AKP升高，可伴发甲亢。\\n(7)家族性高球蛋白血症(TBG)可致甲亢，本病可因家族性有遗传基因缺陷或与用药有关。\\n发病机制\\nGraves病的甲状腺呈弥漫性肿大，可对称性，亦可非对称性，外有完整包膜，表面光滑，血流丰富，滤泡及滤泡上皮细胞增生，由立方形变为柱形，间质淋巴细胞与浆细胞浸润，肝，脾，胸腺及淋巴结等增生肿大，外周血中淋巴细胞增多；反映自身免疫的病理基础，电镜下甲状腺滤泡上皮细胞微绒毛增多，胶质小滴增多，高尔基器肥大，粗面内质网与线粒体增多，溶酶体增多，甲状腺呈功能活跃状态。\\n甲亢时机体多系统器官受累，全身横纹肌脂肪变性，水肿，横纹消失，空泡变性，细胞核呈退行性变，心肌退行性变，肌细胞可发生坏死，单核细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，眼球突出，眼外肌水肿肥大，肌细胞脂肪性变，淋巴细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，视神经水肿或萎缩；皮肤可发生对称性增厚，皮下水肿，胶元纤维肿胀，裂解与分离，细胞外液黏多糖染色增强，有单核细胞增多，多发生在胫骨前及下肢，肝脏肿大，肝细胞呈脂肪退行性变，肝糖原减少，内分泌腺可受累，性腺与肾上腺等在重症患者可发生功能减退，骨质疏松与骨质脱钙比较常见，破骨细胞活性增强，骨吸收多于骨形成，严重时也可发生骨畸形与病理性骨折，青壮年少见，老年女性比较常见。#0.5',\n",

       "     '#甲亢病因#近年来研究发现Graves病的发病主要与自身免疫有关，其他病变引起的甲亢在发病上各有特点或仍有不清之处，现分述如下：\\n免疫因素(30%)：\\n1956年 Adams等发现长效甲状腺刺激素(LATS)作用与TSH作用相近，它是一种由B淋巴细胞产生的免疫球蛋白(IgG)，是一种针对甲状腺的自身抗体，可与甲状腺亚细胞成分结合，兴奋甲状腺滤泡上皮分泌甲状腺激素而引起甲亢。甲亢患者中60%～90%LATS增多，此后又发现LATS-P物质，也是一种IgG，只兴奋人的甲状腺组织，又称为人甲状腺刺激免疫球蛋白(HTSI)，甲亢患者90%以上为阳性。\\n1、甲亢发病免疫机制的直接证据有：\\n(1)在体液免疫方面，已知有多种抗甲状腺细胞成分的抗体，如针对TSH受体的甲状腺刺激性抗体(TISI)，或TSH受体抗体(TRAb)，它能与TSH受体或其相关组织结合，进一步激活cAMP，加强甲状腺功能。这种抗体可通过胎盘组织，引起新生儿甲亢，或甲亢治疗后不彻底，抗体持续阳性，导致甲亢复发。\\n(2)细胞免疫方面，证实这些抗体系由于B淋巴细胞产生。甲亢患者血中有针对甲状腺抗原的致敏T淋巴细胞存在，甲亢时淋巴细胞在植物血凝素(PHA)的激活作用下可产生LATS，PHA兴奋T淋巴细胞后再刺激B淋巴细胞，从而产生能兴奋甲状腺作用的免疫球蛋白，如TSI等，而引发甲亢。器官特异性自身免疫疾病都是由于抑制性T淋巴细胞(Ts)功能缺陷引起免疫调节障碍所致。因此，免疫反应是涉及T与B淋巴细胞及吞噬细胞相互作用的复杂结果。现认为主要与基因缺陷有关的抑制性T淋巴细胞功能降低有关，Ts功能缺陷可导致T细胞致敏，使B细胞产生TRAb而引起甲亢。\\n2、间接证据有：\\n(1)甲状腺及眼球后有大量淋巴细胞及浆细胞浸润。\\n(2)外周血循环中淋巴细胞数增多，可伴发淋巴结，肝与脾的网状内皮组织增生。\\n(3)患者与其亲属同时或先后可发生其他一些自身免疫性疾病。\\n(4)患者及其亲属中的血液抗甲状腺抗体，TRAb及抗胃壁细胞抗体与抗心肌抗体等阳性。\\n(5)甲状腺内与血液中有IgG，IgA及IgM升高。\\nGraves病的诱发始动原因目前认为系由于患者Ts细胞的免疫监护和调节功能有遗传性缺陷，当有外来精神创伤等因素时，或有感染因素时，体内免疫遭破坏，“禁株”细胞失控，产生TSI的B淋巴细胞增生，功能变异，在Ts细胞的作用下分泌大量的TSI自身抗体而致病。有精神创伤与家族史者发病较多，为诱发因素。近年来发现，白种人甲亢HLA-B8比正常人高出2倍，亚洲日本人HLA-BW35增高，国外华人HIA-BW46阳性易感性增高，B13，B40更明显，这些都引起了注意。\\n遗传因素(20%)：\\n临床上发现家族性Graves病不少见，同卵双胎先后患Graves病的可达30%～60%，异卵仅为3%～9%，家族史调查除患甲亢外，还可患其他种甲状腺疾病如甲状腺功能减低等，或家族亲属中TSI阳性。这说明Graves病有家族遗传倾向，这种遗传方式可能为常染色体隐性遗传，或常染色体显性遗传，或为多基因遗传。\\n其他发病原因(10%)：\\n(1)功能亢进性结节性甲状腺肿或腺瘤，过去认为本病多不属于自身免疫性疾病，因血中未检出IgG，TSI，IATS等免疫佐证。1988年国内曾报告单结节检出血清甲状腺球蛋白抗体和微粒体抗体，阳性率为16.9%(62/383)，多结节阳性率为54.7%(104/190)，这些结节中增生的甲状腺组织不受TSI调节，成为自主功能亢进性或功能亢进性甲状腺结节或腺瘤。目前认为甲状腺腺瘤与癌瘤发病还认为系由于肿瘤基因所致。\\n(2)垂体瘤分泌TSH增加，引起垂体性甲亢，如TSH分泌瘤或肢端肥大症所伴发的甲亢。\\n(3)亚急性甲状腺炎，慢性淋巴细胞性甲状腺炎，无痛性甲状腺炎等都可伴发甲亢。\\n(4)外源性碘增多引起甲亢，称为碘甲亢。如甲状腺肿病人服碘过多，服用甲状腺片或左甲状腺素钠(L-T4)过多均可引起甲亢，少数病人服用胺碘酮药物也可致甲亢。\\n(5)异位内分泌肿瘤可致甲亢，如卵巢肿瘤，绒癌，消化系统肿瘤，呼吸系统肿瘤及乳腺癌等分泌类促甲状腺激素可致临床甲亢。\\n(6)Albright综合征在临床上表现为多发性骨纤维结构不良，皮肤色素沉着，血中AKP升高，可伴发甲亢。\\n(7)家族性高球蛋白血症(TBG)可致甲亢，本病可因家族性有遗传基因缺陷或与用药有关。\\n发病机制\\nGraves病的甲状腺呈弥漫性肿大，可对称性，亦可非对称性，外有完整包膜，表面光滑，血流丰富，滤泡及滤泡上皮细胞增生，由立方形变为柱形，间质淋巴细胞与浆细胞浸润，肝，脾，胸腺及淋巴结等增生肿大，外周血中淋巴细胞增多；反映自身免疫的病理基础，电镜下甲状腺滤泡上皮细胞微绒毛增多，胶质小滴增多，高尔基器肥大，粗面内质网与线粒体增多，溶酶体增多，甲状腺呈功能活跃状态。\\n甲亢时机体多系统器官受累，全身横纹肌脂肪变性，水肿，横纹消失，空泡变性，细胞核呈退行性变，心肌退行性变，肌细胞可发生坏死，单核细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，眼球突出，眼外肌水肿肥大，肌细胞脂肪性变，淋巴细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，视神经水肿或萎缩；皮肤可发生对称性增厚，皮下水肿，胶元纤维肿胀，裂解与分离，细胞外液黏多糖染色增强，有单核细胞增多，多发生在胫骨前及下肢，肝脏肿大，肝细胞呈脂肪退行性变，肝糖原减少，内分泌腺可受累，性腺与肾上腺等在重症患者可发生功能减退，骨质疏松与骨质脱钙比较常见，破骨细胞活性增强，骨吸收多于骨形成，严重时也可发生骨畸形与病理性骨折，青壮年少见，老年女性比较常见。#0.5',\n",

       "     '#甲亢病因#近年来研究发现Graves病的发病主要与自身免疫有关，其他病变引起的甲亢在发病上各有特点或仍有不清之处，现分述如下：\\n免疫因素(30%)：\\n1956年 Adams等发现长效甲状腺刺激素(LATS)作用与TSH作用相近，它是一种由B淋巴细胞产生的免疫球蛋白(IgG)，是一种针对甲状腺的自身抗体，可与甲状腺亚细胞成分结合，兴奋甲状腺滤泡上皮分泌甲状腺激素而引起甲亢。甲亢患者中60%～90%LATS增多，此后又发现LATS-P物质，也是一种IgG，只兴奋人的甲状腺组织，又称为人甲状腺刺激免疫球蛋白(HTSI)，甲亢患者90%以上为阳性。\\n1、甲亢发病免疫机制的直接证据有：\\n(1)在体液免疫方面，已知有多种抗甲状腺细胞成分的抗体，如针对TSH受体的甲状腺刺激性抗体(TISI)，或TSH受体抗体(TRAb)，它能与TSH受体或其相关组织结合，进一步激活cAMP，加强甲状腺功能。这种抗体可通过胎盘组织，引起新生儿甲亢，或甲亢治疗后不彻底，抗体持续阳性，导致甲亢复发。\\n(2)细胞免疫方面，证实这些抗体系由于B淋巴细胞产生。甲亢患者血中有针对甲状腺抗原的致敏T淋巴细胞存在，甲亢时淋巴细胞在植物血凝素(PHA)的激活作用下可产生LATS，PHA兴奋T淋巴细胞后再刺激B淋巴细胞，从而产生能兴奋甲状腺作用的免疫球蛋白，如TSI等，而引发甲亢。器官特异性自身免疫疾病都是由于抑制性T淋巴细胞(Ts)功能缺陷引起免疫调节障碍所致。因此，免疫反应是涉及T与B淋巴细胞及吞噬细胞相互作用的复杂结果。现认为主要与基因缺陷有关的抑制性T淋巴细胞功能降低有关，Ts功能缺陷可导致T细胞致敏，使B细胞产生TRAb而引起甲亢。\\n2、间接证据有：\\n(1)甲状腺及眼球后有大量淋巴细胞及浆细胞浸润。\\n(2)外周血循环中淋巴细胞数增多，可伴发淋巴结，肝与脾的网状内皮组织增生。\\n(3)患者与其亲属同时或先后可发生其他一些自身免疫性疾病。\\n(4)患者及其亲属中的血液抗甲状腺抗体，TRAb及抗胃壁细胞抗体与抗心肌抗体等阳性。\\n(5)甲状腺内与血液中有IgG，IgA及IgM升高。\\nGraves病的诱发始动原因目前认为系由于患者Ts细胞的免疫监护和调节功能有遗传性缺陷，当有外来精神创伤等因素时，或有感染因素时，体内免疫遭破坏，“禁株”细胞失控，产生TSI的B淋巴细胞增生，功能变异，在Ts细胞的作用下分泌大量的TSI自身抗体而致病。有精神创伤与家族史者发病较多，为诱发因素。近年来发现，白种人甲亢HLA-B8比正常人高出2倍，亚洲日本人HLA-BW35增高，国外华人HIA-BW46阳性易感性增高，B13，B40更明显，这些都引起了注意。\\n遗传因素(20%)：\\n临床上发现家族性Graves病不少见，同卵双胎先后患Graves病的可达30%～60%，异卵仅为3%～9%，家族史调查除患甲亢外，还可患其他种甲状腺疾病如甲状腺功能减低等，或家族亲属中TSI阳性。这说明Graves病有家族遗传倾向，这种遗传方式可能为常染色体隐性遗传，或常染色体显性遗传，或为多基因遗传。\\n其他发病原因(10%)：\\n(1)功能亢进性结节性甲状腺肿或腺瘤，过去认为本病多不属于自身免疫性疾病，因血中未检出IgG，TSI，IATS等免疫佐证。1988年国内曾报告单结节检出血清甲状腺球蛋白抗体和微粒体抗体，阳性率为16.9%(62/383)，多结节阳性率为54.7%(104/190)，这些结节中增生的甲状腺组织不受TSI调节，成为自主功能亢进性或功能亢进性甲状腺结节或腺瘤。目前认为甲状腺腺瘤与癌瘤发病还认为系由于肿瘤基因所致。\\n(2)垂体瘤分泌TSH增加，引起垂体性甲亢，如TSH分泌瘤或肢端肥大症所伴发的甲亢。\\n(3)亚急性甲状腺炎，慢性淋巴细胞性甲状腺炎，无痛性甲状腺炎等都可伴发甲亢。\\n(4)外源性碘增多引起甲亢，称为碘甲亢。如甲状腺肿病人服碘过多，服用甲状腺片或左甲状腺素钠(L-T4)过多均可引起甲亢，少数病人服用胺碘酮药物也可致甲亢。\\n(5)异位内分泌肿瘤可致甲亢，如卵巢肿瘤，绒癌，消化系统肿瘤，呼吸系统肿瘤及乳腺癌等分泌类促甲状腺激素可致临床甲亢。\\n(6)Albright综合征在临床上表现为多发性骨纤维结构不良，皮肤色素沉着，血中AKP升高，可伴发甲亢。\\n(7)家族性高球蛋白血症(TBG)可致甲亢，本病可因家族性有遗传基因缺陷或与用药有关。\\n发病机制\\nGraves病的甲状腺呈弥漫性肿大，可对称性，亦可非对称性，外有完整包膜，表面光滑，血流丰富，滤泡及滤泡上皮细胞增生，由立方形变为柱形，间质淋巴细胞与浆细胞浸润，肝，脾，胸腺及淋巴结等增生肿大，外周血中淋巴细胞增多；反映自身免疫的病理基础，电镜下甲状腺滤泡上皮细胞微绒毛增多，胶质小滴增多，高尔基器肥大，粗面内质网与线粒体增多，溶酶体增多，甲状腺呈功能活跃状态。\\n甲亢时机体多系统器官受累，全身横纹肌脂肪变性，水肿，横纹消失，空泡变性，细胞核呈退行性变，心肌退行性变，肌细胞可发生坏死，单核细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，眼球突出，眼外肌水肿肥大，肌细胞脂肪性变，淋巴细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，视神经水肿或萎缩；皮肤可发生对称性增厚，皮下水肿，胶元纤维肿胀，裂解与分离，细胞外液黏多糖染色增强，有单核细胞增多，多发生在胫骨前及下肢，肝脏肿大，肝细胞呈脂肪退行性变，肝糖原减少，内分泌腺可受累，性腺与肾上腺等在重症患者可发生功能减退，骨质疏松与骨质脱钙比较常见，破骨细胞活性增强，骨吸收多于骨形成，严重时也可发生骨畸形与病理性骨折，青壮年少见，老年女性比较常见。#0.5',\n",

       "   '#甲亢病因#近年来研究发现Graves病的发病主要与自身免疫有关，其他病变引起的甲亢在发病上各有特点或仍有不清之处，现分述如下：\\n免疫因素(30%)：\\n1956年 Adams等发现长效甲状腺刺激素(LATS)作用与TSH作用相近，它是一种由B淋巴细胞产生的免疫球蛋白(IgG)，是一种针对甲状腺的自身抗体，可与甲状腺亚细胞成分结合，兴奋甲状腺滤泡上皮分泌甲状腺激素而引起甲亢。甲亢患者中60%～90%LATS增多，此后又发现LATS-P物质，也是一种IgG，只兴奋人的甲状腺组织，又称为人甲状腺刺激免疫球蛋白(HTSI)，甲亢患者90%以上为阳性。\\n1、甲亢发病免疫机制的直接证据有：\\n(1)在体液免疫方面，已知有多种抗甲状腺细胞成分的抗体，如针对TSH受体的甲状腺刺激性抗体(TISI)，或TSH受体抗体(TRAb)，它能与TSH受体或其相关组织结合，进一步激活cAMP，加强甲状腺功能。这种抗体可通过胎盘组织，引起新生儿甲亢，或甲亢治疗后不彻底，抗体持续阳性，导致甲亢复发。\\n(2)细胞免疫方面，证实这些抗体系由于B淋巴细胞产生。甲亢患者血中有针对甲状腺抗原的致敏T淋巴细胞存在，甲亢时淋巴细胞在植物血凝素(PHA)的激活作用下可产生LATS，PHA兴奋T淋巴细胞后再刺激B淋巴细胞，从而产生能兴奋甲状腺作用的免疫球蛋白，如TSI等，而引发甲亢。器官特异性自身免疫疾病都是由于抑制性T淋巴细胞(Ts)功能缺陷引起免疫调节障碍所致。因此，免疫反应是涉及T与B淋巴细胞及吞噬细胞相互作用的复杂结果。现认为主要与基因缺陷有关的抑制性T淋巴细胞功能降低有关，Ts功能缺陷可导致T细胞致敏，使B细胞产生TRAb而引起甲亢。\\n2、间接证据有：\\n(1)甲状腺及眼球后有大量淋巴细胞及浆细胞浸润。\\n(2)外周血循环中淋巴细胞数增多，可伴发淋巴结，肝与脾的网状内皮组织增生。\\n(3)患者与其亲属同时或先后可发生其他一些自身免疫性疾病。\\n(4)患者及其亲属中的血液抗甲状腺抗体，TRAb及抗胃壁细胞抗体与抗心肌抗体等阳性。\\n(5)甲状腺内与血液中有IgG，IgA及IgM升高。\\nGraves病的诱发始动原因目前认为系由于患者Ts细胞的免疫监护和调节功能有遗传性缺陷，当有外来精神创伤等因素时，或有感染因素时，体内免疫遭破坏，“禁株”细胞失控，产生TSI的B淋巴细胞增生，功能变异，在Ts细胞的作用下分泌大量的TSI自身抗体而致病。有精神创伤与家族史者发病较多，为诱发因素。近年来发现，白种人甲亢HLA-B8比正常人高出2倍，亚洲日本人HLA-BW35增高，国外华人HIA-BW46阳性易感性增高，B13，B40更明显，这些都引起了注意。\\n遗传因素(20%)：\\n临床上发现家族性Graves病不少见，同卵双胎先后患Graves病的可达30%～60%，异卵仅为3%～9%，家族史调查除患甲亢外，还可患其他种甲状腺疾病如甲状腺功能减低等，或家族亲属中TSI阳性。这说明Graves病有家族遗传倾向，这种遗传方式可能为常染色体隐性遗传，或常染色体显性遗传，或为多基因遗传。\\n其他发病原因(10%)：\\n(1)功能亢进性结节性甲状腺肿或腺瘤，过去认为本病多不属于自身免疫性疾病，因血中未检出IgG，TSI，IATS等免疫佐证。1988年国内曾报告单结节检出血清甲状腺球蛋白抗体和微粒体抗体，阳性率为16.9%(62/383)，多结节阳性率为54.7%(104/190)，这些结节中增生的甲状腺组织不受TSI调节，成为自主功能亢进性或功能亢进性甲状腺结节或腺瘤。目前认为甲状腺腺瘤与癌瘤发病还认为系由于肿瘤基因所致。\\n(2)垂体瘤分泌TSH增加，引起垂体性甲亢，如TSH分泌瘤或肢端肥大症所伴发的甲亢。\\n(3)亚急性甲状腺炎，慢性淋巴细胞性甲状腺炎，无痛性甲状腺炎等都可伴发甲亢。\\n(4)外源性碘增多引起甲亢，称为碘甲亢。如甲状腺肿病人服碘过多，服用甲状腺片或左甲状腺素钠(L-T4)过多均可引起甲亢，少数病人服用胺碘酮药物也可致甲亢。\\n(5)异位内分泌肿瘤可致甲亢，如卵巢肿瘤，绒癌，消化系统肿瘤，呼吸系统肿瘤及乳腺癌等分泌类促甲状腺激素可致临床甲亢。\\n(6)Albright综合征在临床上表现为多发性骨纤维结构不良，皮肤色素沉着，血中AKP升高，可伴发甲亢。\\n(7)家族性高球蛋白血症(TBG)可致甲亢，本病可因家族性有遗传基因缺陷或与用药有关。\\n发病机制\\nGraves病的甲状腺呈弥漫性肿大，可对称性，亦可非对称性，外有完整包膜，表面光滑，血流丰富，滤泡及滤泡上皮细胞增生，由立方形变为柱形，间质淋巴细胞与浆细胞浸润，肝，脾，胸腺及淋巴结等增生肿大，外周血中淋巴细胞增多；反映自身免疫的病理基础，电镜下甲状腺滤泡上皮细胞微绒毛增多，胶质小滴增多，高尔基器肥大，粗面内质网与线粒体增多，溶酶体增多，甲状腺呈功能活跃状态。\\n甲亢时机体多系统器官受累，全身横纹肌脂肪变性，水肿，横纹消失，空泡变性，细胞核呈退行性变，心肌退行性变，肌细胞可发生坏死，单核细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，眼球突出，眼外肌水肿肥大，肌细胞脂肪性变，淋巴细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，视神经水肿或萎缩；皮肤可发生对称性增厚，皮下水肿，胶元纤维肿胀，裂解与分离，细胞外液黏多糖染色增强，有单核细胞增多，多发生在胫骨前及下肢，肝脏肿大，肝细胞呈脂肪退行性变，肝糖原减少，内分泌腺可受累，性腺与肾上腺等在重症患者可发生功能减退，骨质疏松与骨质脱钙比较常见，破骨细胞活性增强，骨吸收多于骨形成，严重时也可发生骨畸形与病理性骨折，青壮年少见，老年女性比较常见。',\n",

       "  'rerank docs': ['#甲亢病因#近年来研究发现Graves病的发病主要与自身免疫有关，其他病变引起的甲亢在发病上各有特点或仍有不清之处，现分述如下：\\n免疫因素(30%)：\\n1956年 Adams等发现长效甲状腺刺激素(LATS)作用与TSH作用相近，它是一种由B淋巴细胞产生的免疫球蛋白(IgG)，是一种针对甲状腺的自身抗体，可与甲状腺亚细胞成分结合，兴奋甲状腺滤泡上皮分泌甲状腺激素而引起甲亢。甲亢患者中60%～90%LATS增多，此后又发现LATS-P物质，也是一种IgG，只兴奋人的甲状腺组织，又称为人甲状腺刺激免疫球蛋白(HTSI)，甲亢患者90%以上为阳性。\\n1、甲亢发病免疫机制的直接证据有：\\n(1)在体液免疫方面，已知有多种抗甲状腺细胞成分的抗体，如针对TSH受体的甲状腺刺激性抗体(TISI)，或TSH受体抗体(TRAb)，它能与TSH受体或其相关组织结合，进一步激活cAMP，加强甲状腺功能。这种抗体可通过胎盘组织，引起新生儿甲亢，或甲亢治疗后不彻底，抗体持续阳性，导致甲亢复发。\\n(2)细胞免疫方面，证实这些抗体系由于B淋巴细胞产生。甲亢患者血中有针对甲状腺抗原的致敏T淋巴细胞存在，甲亢时淋巴细胞在植物血凝素(PHA)的激活作用下可产生LATS，PHA兴奋T淋巴细胞后再刺激B淋巴细胞，从而产生能兴奋甲状腺作用的免疫球蛋白，如TSI等，而引发甲亢。器官特异性自身免疫疾病都是由于抑制性T淋巴细胞(Ts)功能缺陷引起免疫调节障碍所致。因此，免疫反应是涉及T与B淋巴细胞及吞噬细胞相互作用的复杂结果。现认为主要与基因缺陷有关的抑制性T淋巴细胞功能降低有关，Ts功能缺陷可导致T细胞致敏，使B细胞产生TRAb而引起甲亢。\\n2、间接证据有：\\n(1)甲状腺及眼球后有大量淋巴细胞及浆细胞浸润。\\n(2)外周血循环中淋巴细胞数增多，可伴发淋巴结，肝与脾的网状内皮组织增生。\\n(3)患者与其亲属同时或先后可发生其他一些自身免疫性疾病。\\n(4)患者及其亲属中的血液抗甲状腺抗体，TRAb及抗胃壁细胞抗体与抗心肌抗体等阳性。\\n(5)甲状腺内与血液中有IgG，IgA及IgM升高。\\nGraves病的诱发始动原因目前认为系由于患者Ts细胞的免疫监护和调节功能有遗传性缺陷，当有外来精神创伤等因素时，或有感染因素时，体内免疫遭破坏，“禁株”细胞失控，产生TSI的B淋巴细胞增生，功能变异，在Ts细胞的作用下分泌大量的TSI自身抗体而致病。有精神创伤与家族史者发病较多，为诱发因素。近年来发现，白种人甲亢HLA-B8比正常人高出2倍，亚洲日本人HLA-BW35增高，国外华人HIA-BW46阳性易感性增高，B13，B40更明显，这些都引起了注意。\\n遗传因素(20%)：\\n临床上发现家族性Graves病不少见，同卵双胎先后患Graves病的可达30%～60%，异卵仅为3%～9%，家族史调查除患甲亢外，还可患其他种甲状腺疾病如甲状腺功能减低等，或家族亲属中TSI阳性。这说明Graves病有家族遗传倾向，这种遗传方式可能为常染色体隐性遗传，或常染色体显性遗传，或为多基因遗传。\\n其他发病原因(10%)：\\n(1)功能亢进性结节性甲状腺肿或腺瘤，过去认为本病多不属于自身免疫性疾病，因血中未检出IgG，TSI，IATS等免疫佐证。1988年国内曾报告单结节检出血清甲状腺球蛋白抗体和微粒体抗体，阳性率为16.9%(62/383)，多结节阳性率为54.7%(104/190)，这些结节中增生的甲状腺组织不受TSI调节，成为自主功能亢进性或功能亢进性甲状腺结节或腺瘤。目前认为甲状腺腺瘤与癌瘤发病还认为系由于肿瘤基因所致。\\n(2)垂体瘤分泌TSH增加，引起垂体性甲亢，如TSH分泌瘤或肢端肥大症所伴发的甲亢。\\n(3)亚急性甲状腺炎，慢性淋巴细胞性甲状腺炎，无痛性甲状腺炎等都可伴发甲亢。\\n(4)外源性碘增多引起甲亢，称为碘甲亢。如甲状腺肿病人服碘过多，服用甲状腺片或左甲状腺素钠(L-T4)过多均可引起甲亢，少数病人服用胺碘酮药物也可致甲亢。\\n(5)异位内分泌肿瘤可致甲亢，如卵巢肿瘤，绒癌，消化系统肿瘤，呼吸系统肿瘤及乳腺癌等分泌类促甲状腺激素可致临床甲亢。\\n(6)Albright综合征在临床上表现为多发性骨纤维结构不良，皮肤色素沉着，血中AKP升高，可伴发甲亢。\\n(7)家族性高球蛋白血症(TBG)可致甲亢，本病可因家族性有遗传基因缺陷或与用药有关。\\n发病机制\\nGraves病的甲状腺呈弥漫性肿大，可对称性，亦可非对称性，外有完整包膜，表面光滑，血流丰富，滤泡及滤泡上皮细胞增生，由立方形变为柱形，间质淋巴细胞与浆细胞浸润，肝，脾，胸腺及淋巴结等增生肿大，外周血中淋巴细胞增多；反映自身免疫的病理基础，电镜下甲状腺滤泡上皮细胞微绒毛增多，胶质小滴增多，高尔基器肥大，粗面内质网与线粒体增多，溶酶体增多，甲状腺呈功能活跃状态。\\n甲亢时机体多系统器官受累，全身横纹肌脂肪变性，水肿，横纹消失，空泡变性，细胞核呈退行性变，心肌退行性变，肌细胞可发生坏死，单核细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，眼球突出，眼外肌水肿肥大，肌细胞脂肪性变，淋巴细胞浸润，黏多糖沉积，视神经水肿或萎缩；皮肤可发生对称性增厚，皮下水肿，胶元纤维肿胀，裂解与分离，细胞外液黏多糖染色增强，有单核细胞增多，多发生在胫骨前及下肢，肝脏肿大，肝细胞呈脂肪退行性变，肝糖原减少，内分泌腺可受累，性腺与肾上腺等在重症患者可发生功能减退，骨质疏松与骨质脱钙比较常见，破骨细胞活性增强，骨吸收多于骨形成，严重时也可发生骨畸形与病理性骨折，青壮年少见，老年女性比较常见。',\n",
